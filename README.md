# LIBR_MOCD
Repository for the LIBR Meth Opioid Cue Reactivity Database.


This is in-progress, and not ready for download/use yet!


Once complete, there will be three folders:
The individual subject responses and analysis characterizing the database.
The code behind the webserver that was used to collect rating data.
The six task versions, implemented in psychopy.
